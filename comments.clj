For example, there's a nice soft shadow behind the upside-down guy, that makes him stand out from the background.  But the standing-up guy doesn't have enough separation from the background or the carpet." "Yeah as a fellow PhD, I've felt some degree of \"I've achieved every goal yet feel depressed\" kind of thing.  I think grad school can have the tendency to do that to some people.

"On many lenses you'll get best sharpness at f5.6 to f8, but you'll get better subject separation and better bokeh (background blurring) at f1.8 to f2.8.   It is up to you to decide what's most important to you - do you want to see detail in the background, or not." "Yes, sometimes it unintentionally removes color from objects or details in the image.

" "Get mom or dad to co-sign on your rental.  I've done it many times because I also had no credit history.  I've also been turned down many times because a place would not take co-signers.

It's just so much harder to get a job out of grad school without any work experience.  You have so many more opportunities available to you.

"Disadvantage - a good DSLR just beats mirrorless in certain arenas, particularly speed, but others as well (battery life, viewfinder).  That applies to getting all your settings dialed in rapidly, but also just pure autofocus speed is typically better on a DSLR.  Focus peaking in mirrorless is useful, but in many circumstances even with an electronic viewfinder I find it difficult to get exactly the focus I want (especially difficult to get precision focusing quickly).  I find mirrorless difficult to use in very bright sunlight, although the autofocus works better in bright conditions so the chance of getting sharp, properly exposed photos is high to begin with.

" "I was originally sold on the GX7 myself based on online research, but after playing around with a few cameras in the store, decided to go with a NEX-6.  I thought the interface was more to my liking overall.  I think GX7 has better electronics overall (plus in-body stabilization) but I wasn't convinced about the longevity of the MFT sensor.  I am not in the camp that thinks APS-C is that much better than MFT (I see plenty of arguments to the contrary) but wasn't disappointed to end up with APS-C in the end.

But then your male subject is underexposed and for lack of a better term, not looking very \"interesting\".  Since I can't tell what he's doing there, it is a bit distracting to have him there at all.

" "I was also looking at the GX7, but I ended up buying a NEX 6.  I couldn't convince myself that there was enough \"meat\" there on the Panasonic to justify the extra cost.  I personally didn't like the overall interface as much, and was not sure about buying into the MFT sensor versus the much more common APS-C.  You spend a bit more for the body on the GX7 since it has in-camera stabilization, whereas Sony puts OSS in the lenses.

They are boring pictures, but they come out great when you put them into technical reports.  I hate when \"the new guy\" takes pictures on full auto, even just \"casual\" pics.  Why?

Then I'm stuck putting a blurry pic into a powerpoint report and looking like I don't care about quality.

Shoot indoor by a window during late afternoon or outside in the shade around sunset.  See how it goes.

For example shooting portraits, you could eliminate the reflections off of people's hair that often is primarily polarized light.  That hair reflection is often desirable in portraits.  " "The vignetting is a little on the strong side.  The shadows are a little harsh on the chairs, while the sky and sea are a bit muddy.

Depending on what lens you have there, your lowest f stop may be around f/2.8 or f/4." "The repercussions are not really that severe, if you choose to switch to a new job immediately after starting another job.  That is, it would be a bit worse if you left right after receiving a bunch of training and you really got settled in, but were there for total of less than a year.  " "You won't be able to take good handheld shots at 1/5\" .  Try to get the shutter speed faster, in the 1/60 - 1/125 range for poorly lit indoor situations while handheld.

There is certainly a \"market\" for such relationships, but it doesn't necessarily make for healthy relationships." "tl;dr - when the core of a star of a certain size collapses due to a supernova, what is left over gets really dense.  The increased density means it has decreased in size... by a lot.  Since the star's angular momentum (associated with its rotation) is \"conserved\" in this transformation, the resulting neutron star typically starts spinning really fast.  This fast spinning makes them easier to find (despite being very small) and hence why we know about them (pulsars) today.

"Sounds like voltage droop of the battery under load (\"load\" being the starter trying to kick in).  Battery is likely bad.

"We know the mass does not disappear.  The event horizon increases in size, so mass is conserved.  The best description of where the matter goes is that it becomes a singularity.  The matter stops taking up space.  In order for matter to take up space, there are always competing forces - one example is electron repulsion (i.e. Pauli exclusion principle) that works against gravity.  Once you have enough mass, no other forces in our universe can compete, and the matter collapses into a singularity.  This is often described as our \"physics breaking down\".

The executives would show up to public service events with firemen, police, and paramedics, and smile and have their pictures taken, then at the end of the year list all of the \"safety and public awareness\" events that they \"organized\" and participated in, but apply for more funding the next year because they didn't get to do the \"real work they were planning to do, due to lack of resources.\"  Rinse and repeat for 15 years, try to fly under the radar while collecting an attractive pension plan, retire wealthy."

Chemical reactions that produce electrical current are slower at cold temperatures. This causes voltage to droop when you try to pull \"a lot\" of current out of the battery (trying to start the car), but the voltage may not droop much when you are only pulling \"a little\" current out of the battery (operating lights, radio, etc).\nClicking of the starter and blinking interior lights when attempting to start the vehicle is a common sign that the battery is having some voltage droop under load."

With Lightroom you can use radial filters or brush tool to very subtly add or subtract vibrance, saturation, or add or subtract some light.

You want someone experienced on your side helping make sure communications, written and otherwise, are done correctly and are up to your specs.  Then someone experienced will help make sure payment is done in a logical and fair manner - with certain % of the project being done at a time, and corresponding payment in line with each % completion.  This helps avoid situations where the contractor asks for a big payment and then disappears.  This happens more often than you think - sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.

In short, it didn't feel like it was really saving me any time or work.  Once it started losing battery life, it would routinely fail to make it back to the charging station in time, and I would have to manually charge it.

To determine settings, work backwards from how long you want your exposure to be.  Do you need 30 seconds to do your light painting?  Or just 5 seconds?  That is a big question.  Then you can effectively use shutter priority (if you don't care much about controlling depth of field) or full manual (you have a specific aperture in mind).

First being - many contractors are not as easy to communicate with as you think, and unless you're going to sit there and babysit them (which won't go over well either), your relationship with your contractor is going to be primarily periodic communications.  They may have an email address, that doesn't mean they are going to read your very detailed email or handwritten notes explaining all the things you want done a certain way.

This \"lithiated graphite\" electrode is reactive, chemically.  (Lithium metal is even more reactive).  It reacts with the electrolyte and its solvent in the battery.  A very thin layer of reaction products forms at the surface of the electrode, called the SEI layer.  This layer increases in thickness over time and causes the battery's internal resistance to increase, which gives you less and less power over time.
